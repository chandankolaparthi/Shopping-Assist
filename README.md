# Shopping-Assist

My idea is to build a personal shopping assistant which can detect the product you are looking at and find the
same product in different websites, sellers who may provide it for cheaper. It can also find the product just by
taking a photo of it. It will also keep track of its price during the last few days and suggests if you should wait.
It can also apply the best coupon if there are any available. It basically ensures you get the best price
everytime.
